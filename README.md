Experimental app I've "designed" with ChatGPT.

I wanted to write an app but didn't have much time, but also wanted to experiment with ChatGPT at the same time, which I've never done before.  For simple apps like this with fairly simple features, it's laughably easy.  I spent maybe 10 minutes creating this and didn't tweak a single line of code.  I just asked the app to fix something things.

But yeah it's free use, not like I really wrote it, produced at best, really.  If you have any feature suggestions or issues just post an issue.

Keep in mind the app has some dangerous actions.  If you export the blank table as JSON, obviously you'll get a functionally blank file out of it.  However, if you save a blank table to your cookies it will overwrite what you have already saved to be just blank, essentially a reset.  At some point I may add a confirmation popup but eh.
